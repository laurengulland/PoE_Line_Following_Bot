#Test Demo Videos
See sample videos of our testing!
- __Triangle_turn_and_sharp_curve__: Robot succesfully followed the triangular angled turn at the end of the track through past the sharp U-turn curve at the beginning of the track.
- __gradual_curve_and_angle_turn__: Robot succesfully followed the large gradual curve halfway around the track and followed the semi-sharp turn after that, but was misaligned after that and lost track.
- __gradual_angle_curve_endfail__: Same as above, was doing better, but provided equipment (we believe it was the motors or power cable) failed during test. Looked promising though.... :(
